# Overview

<!-- {Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.} -->
This software was developed to enhance skills with analyzing data programmatically. The goal with this project is to practice utilizing the functions from the Python Pandas library.

<!-- {Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing.  Include the link of where you obtained the data.} -->
The data being analyzed is a breakdown of nutritional facts collected regarding several menu items from different fast food restaurants, such as McDonalds, Subway, or Chick-Fil-A.
Dataset for Fast Food Nutrition Information found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/fastfood-nutrition?resource=download).

<!-- {Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.} -->


<!-- {Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.} -->
